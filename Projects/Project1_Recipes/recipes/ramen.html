    <!-- Steps to cook using ordered list element -->
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <p><strong>Chashu Pork</strong></p>
            <li>Pre-heat your oven to 290F.</li>
            <li>Combine the soy, mirin, sake and sugar.</li>
            <li>Place the pork belly in a baking dish that's not too much bigger than the pork belly.</li>
            <li>Pour the soy mixture over the pork and cover the baking dish with tin foil. You want to get it fairly well sealed.</li>
            <li>Place the pork in the pre-heated oven and cook, turning the dish occasionally to ensure even cooking. 
                You are going for an internal temperature of 195F. 
                This will take about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>When you hit 195F remove the pork from the marinade and chill.
                Cool the marinade down and skim and discard the fat from the surface. 
                This chashu braising liquid is going to be the base of your ramen broth flavouring. 
            </li>


        <p><strong>Medium Boiled Eggs</strong></p>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. 
                Boil large eggs for 6 minutes 30 seconds. 
                If using extra large eggs boil them for 7 minutes 30 seconds. 
                You may have to adjust your times slightly depending on the exact size of your eggs but this should get you pretty close.
            </li>
            <li>Submerge the eggs in really cold or ice water to chill. 
                This stops the egg yolks from continuing to set up.
                Peel and set aside. They will warm up in the broth.
            </li>


        <p><strong>Miso tare - the flavouring</strong></p>
            <li>Combine the chashu braising liquid with 1/2 cup shiro miso 
                in a small sauce pan over medium low heat.
            </li>
            <li>Warm the chashu miso mixture, mixing the miso gently. 
                It will go in as a 1/2 cup lump so you are trying to get 
                it to gradually dissolve.
            </li>
            <li>Add the bacon and simmer, covered, over the lowest heat for 1 hour. 
                Keep an eye on it. You may need to add a bit of chicken stock to thin it out a bit. 
                You want to wind up with about the same amount of miso tare that you started with. 
                Remove and discard the bacon.
            </li>      
            
            
        <p><strong>Miso ramen</strong></p>
            <li>Cook the noodles per the instructions on the package. 
                If the instructions are in Japanese 4 minutes is about right for the thin ramen noodles. 
                Drain and set aside. Don't let them sit too long. Try to time it so the noodles are ready when you are ready to assemble the ramen bowls.
            </li>
            <li>Heat the chicken broth to a simmer. 
            </li>
            <li>Using your sharpest thin knife cut the eggs in half lengthwise. 
                They will be a bit runny inside so be ready.
            </li>
            <li>Slice the pork belly. You want it about 3/16 inches thick. Warm it in the chicken broth briefly.
            </li>
            <li>Add about 4 Tbsp miso tare to each of 4 pre-warmed bowls. 
                Then add 2 cups of chicken stock to each bowl. Stir and taste. 
                You will want to add a bit more tare. You are going for the point where you are not quite sure if it's too salty. 
                That's when it's perfect. This should be around 5 Tbsp but really this is up to your taste. 
                It will probably be less if you used regular sodium soy sauce or there was sodium in your chicken broth.
            </li>
            <li>Add the noodles, then add the pork belly, egg, and enoki mushrooms. Garnish with green onions and serve.
            </li>
    </ol>
