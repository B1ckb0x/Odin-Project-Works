    <!-- Description of Onigiri -->
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Onigiri (おにぎり) are Japanese rice balls made of steamed rice that you compress into a triangular, ball, or cylinder shape and are usually wrapped in a nori seaweed sheet. 
        You can flavor them lightly with just salt or add a variety of fillings.
    </p>

    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Furikake</li>
        <li>Nori (flat seaweed)</li>
        <li> Filling of yur choice (salmon, chicken)</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Instructions -->
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. 
            Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly. 
            Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.
        </li>
        <li>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. 
            This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.
        </li>
        <li>Take up one portion of rice in your hands.
        </li>
        <li>If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, 
            place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.
        </li>
    </ol>
